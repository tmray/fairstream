Subject: Small feed additions + CORS headers to help apps consume Faircamp RSS

Hi Faircamp team,

I'm building a small music streaming app that can subscribe to Faircamp sites. I love Faircamp's RSS output, but for client apps running in browsers (and many podcast/music apps) it's helpful if the feed includes direct links to audio files and the server sends CORS headers. I put together a short example feed (`example_feed.rss`) showing the minimal changes that make feeds immediately consumable by apps.

What the app needs (minimal, backward compatible):

1) Include an <enclosure> element in each <item> pointing to the audio file. Example:

   <enclosure url="https://your-site/path/to/track.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="1234567" />

   This is the standard RSS way to attach media and is widely supported by players. `type` is the MIME type and `length` is the file size in bytes.

2) (Optional but recommended) Include media:content for richer metadata and thumbnails:

   <media:content url="https://.../track.mp3" fileSize="1234567" type="audio/mpeg" duration="202">
       <media:title>Track Name</media:title>
       <media:thumbnail url="https://.../cover.jpg" />
   </media:content>

3) Add CORS headers for the feed and the media files so browser-based clients can fetch them. At minimum:

   Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
   Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, OPTIONS
   Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin, Content-Type, Accept

   If Faircamp is served from S3/CloudFront, these can be set on the origin or via CloudFront behaviors. For nginx, an example config is:

   location / {
     add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*';
     add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET, OPTIONS';
     add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'Origin, Content-Type, Accept';
     ...
   }

Why this helps
- Apps can load and play tracks directly from the feed without scraping HTML pages.
- Podcast players and media libraries will show track durations and artwork.
- Browser-based apps won't be blocked by CORS errors.

I've attached a tiny example RSS (`example_feed.rss`) showing two items with `enclosure`, `media:content`, and `itunes:` tags. If you'd like, I can open a small PR or provide a patch/hook suggestion for Faircamp so these fields are generated automatically from uploaded audio assets.

Thanks for making Faircamp — happy to help test or iterate on a patch.

Best,
[Your Name]
